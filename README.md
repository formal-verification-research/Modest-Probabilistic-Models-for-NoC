# Formal NoC Verification

This repository is dedicated to probabilistic NoC verification using the
Modest toolset under Dr. Zhen Zhang at Utah State University.

## Repository Layout

Each sub-directory in this repository has it's own README file with
instructions on how to read, use, and extend the work in that
directory.

- [CurrentModels](./CurrentModels/): Contains probabilistic NoC models in
  Modest.
- [PreviousModels](./PreviousModels/): Contains previous works (both
  published and not published).
= [Tools](./Tools/): Contains tools for automating verification.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository used to be laid out quite differently. If you would
> like to see the old layout, check out the
> ["`pre-cleanup`"](https://github.com/formal-verification-research/Modest-Probabilistic-Models-for-NoC/releases/tag/pre-cleanup) tag.
