# Roberts 2020

This model is the 2x2 model Riley used in his FMICS 2021 paper, "Probabilistic Verification for Reliability of a Two-by-Two Network-on-Chip System." In 2025 the model was updated to better reflect the operation of the modular model such that we can generate reproducible comparisons. The logic of the model was not changed, only the formatting and re-introduction of the PSN tracking variables.
