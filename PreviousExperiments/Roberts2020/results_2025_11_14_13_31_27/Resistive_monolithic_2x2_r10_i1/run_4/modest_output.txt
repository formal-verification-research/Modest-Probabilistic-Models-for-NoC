Command: modest modes /tmp/tmpu4xz6l4d/__tmp__.modest --unsafe --max-run-length 0 -D --rng MersenneTwister -E "RESISTIVE_THRESH=10, INDUCTIVE_THRESH=1" -O /tmp/tmpu4xz6l4d/__tmp__.txt minimal




__tmp__.modest: info: __tmp__ is a DTMC model and will be simulated as an MDP using uniform resolution of nondeterminism.
__tmp__.modest: info: Using default confidence level of 0.95.
__tmp__.modest: info: Using default absolute half-width of 0.01.
