# New Probabilities

This is an attempt to measure the probability of PSN at each router in each clock cycle
as opposed to measuring cumulative PSN.

Initial results of testing this out are in
[this directory](./results_2025_11_18_21_25_32/Resistive_new_prob_3x3_a3/), and show that
this method has promise.
[This plot](./results_2025_11_18_21_25_32/Resistive_new_prob_3x3_a3/plots_2025_11_19_13_21_49_of_Resistive_new_prob_3x3_a3/plot.pdf)
shows the probability that eventually within $K$ clock cycles the activity level of a
router will be above 3. This does _not_ guarantee the probability of a router having a
activity level of 3, but rather provides an upper bound of the activity level for each
router at each clock cycle.

## Generating Results

[newProbDriver](./newProbDriver.py) is provided to generate results. Currently it's set up
to generate the probability of seeing an activity level of at least $A$ for resistive and
inductive PSN up to 1000 clock cycles where $A \in \{2,3,4,5\}$.

[generateGraphFiles](./generateGraphFiles.py) is a tool that takes a result directory as a
cli input and then generates both a plot and plot files for that experiment. The plot is a
simple PDF generated by matplotlib, and the files are in the format expected by TikZ in
LaTeX.
