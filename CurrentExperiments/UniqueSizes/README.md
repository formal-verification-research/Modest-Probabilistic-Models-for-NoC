# New Probabilities

This is an attempt at generating results of different (non-square) mesh NoCs.

These files use the router centric approach to calculating PSN and neighborless
initialization.

## Generating Results

[sizeDriver](./sizeDriver.py) is provided to generate results.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To make plots, you will need to install matplotlib separately, as it's not a required

> ```shell
> source .venv/bin/activate # Activate virtual environment
> pip install matplotlib

[generateGraphFiles](./generateGraphFiles.py) is a tool that takes a result directory as a
cli input and then generates both a plot and plot files for that experiment. The plot is a
simple PDF generated by matplotlib, and the files are in the format expected by TikZ in
LaTeX.
