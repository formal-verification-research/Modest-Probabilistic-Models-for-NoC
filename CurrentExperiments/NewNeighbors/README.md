# New Probabilities

This is an attempt to remove the `ids` member of the router datatype and use a function to
calculate the identifiers of neighboring routers instead. It's expected that this will likely
shrink the state space, but will increase verification time.

These files use the router centric approach to calculating PSN.

## Generating Results

[neighborDriver](./neighborDriver.py) is provided to generate results. Currently it's set up
to generate the probability of seeing an activity level of at least $A$ for resistive and
inductive PSN up to 1000 clock cycles where $A \in \{2,3,4,5\}$.

[generateGraphFiles](./generateGraphFiles.py) is a tool that takes a result directory as a
cli input and then generates both a plot and plot files for that experiment. The plot is a
simple PDF generated by matplotlib, and the files are in the format expected by TikZ in
LaTeX.
